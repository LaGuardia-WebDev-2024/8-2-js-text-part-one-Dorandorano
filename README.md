## Directions

### Step #1 - First, a heading! <br>

We're making a list of your favorite foods, but first we need a header. Write 'My Favorite Foods' near the top of the canvas.
<br><br>
Tip: If there is a problem with a text command, make sure that command has:
- Quotation marks around the entire message, like so: "My Favorite Foods";
- Commas in the right places, between every argument;
- Exactly 3 arguments: the message, the x position and the y position.
<br><br>

### Step #2 - BIGGER text! <br>

That text is small, aye? Let's make it easier to read by making the text bigger. You can change the size of your text by using the textSize command before the text command.
<br><br>

### Step #3 - Now, the foods! <br>

Now, use the `text()` command three times, to make a list of your favorite foods. Each should be on a separate line.
